    <h3><b>Kiyomizu-dera</b></h3> 
    <p>Situated in the eastern Higashiyama area, Kiyomizu-dera is one of the most famous and celebrated temples in Kyoto.  The temple was founded in 778 AD and contains buildings from the 17th century, including a main hall designated as a National Treasure.  The temple’s wooden stage is undoubtedly what the temple is most famous for, offering an outstanding panoramic view of Kyoto rising out of a sea of maples.  Drink the sacred water filled with good karma at the Otowa no Taki waterfall, wish for a loving relationship at the Jishu Shrine, venture into the “womb of the bodhisattva” tunnel and admire the numerous examples of beautiful architecture… There are countless ways you can enjoy Kiyomizu-dera.<br/></br><i>Source: https://www.discoverkyoto.com/</i></p>

    <h3><b>Kinkaku-ji</b></h3> 
    <p>Its famous Golden Pavilion (Kinkaku)—actually a pagoda made to house the sacred relics of the Buddha—has given this temple the popular name of Kinkaku-ji (“Temple of the Golden Pavilion”), however the official name of this branch temple of the Rinzai-sect Zen temple of Shokoku-ji is Rokuon-ji. The temple was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994.<br/></br><i>Source: https://www.shokoku-ji.jp/</i></p>

    <h3><b>Sagano Bamboo Forest</b></h3> 
    <p>One of the most photographed sights in Kyoto, the bamboo forest in Sagano Arashiyama is a natural gem.  Walking under the shade of the towering bamboo, you can feel somewhat lost in nature despite having been in a bustling open area moments before.  The bamboo forest has entrances accessible from the main shopping street, Nonomiya Shrine, or Tenryū-ji’s gardens, and leads you up a slope until you arrive at the Ōkōchi Sansō Villa.  Depending on the season it can be rather crowded on the path, but the wonder of peering off to the side into stalk after stalk of old bamboo growth isn’t diminished no matter the surrounding people.  Some choose to take a rickshaw ride through the forest for an added experience.<br/></br><i>Source: https://www.discoverkyoto.com/</i></p>
